Pneumonia chest x ray classification using PyTorch
This project demonstrates the potential of AI to assist in medical diagnosis while maintaining transparency through explainable AI techniques. The combination of high sensitivity and model interpretability addresses two critical requirements for AI in healthcare: effectiveness and trustworthiness.
The transfer learning model's improved performance on normal cases while maintaining excellent pneumonia detection makes it the preferred approach for potential clinical implementation. However, the remaining challenge of false positives (normal X-rays classified as pneumonia) suggests that these models would be best deployed as assistive tools for radiologists rather than autonomous diagnostic systems.
